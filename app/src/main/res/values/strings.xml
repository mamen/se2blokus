    <string name="rules">&lt;b&gt;Rules:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each player gets to place one piece per turn. The goal of the game is to play all your pieces eventually. Each player should begin in a separate corner and works inward from there. After the first turn, you can play anywhere on the board.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most important and ONLY rule of Blokus - the piece you play must touch the corner of at least one of your other pieces and should never touch the side of any of your own pieces. You can touch the sides of other player\'s pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;End of the game:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The game ends for a player when a player is blocked and is not able to place any pieces on the board according to the rules. The game itself ends when no one can place any more pieces on the board anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scoring:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each stone gives you points according to it\'s size. A bonus of 15 points is awarded, if all 21 pieces got placed on the board. A bumper bonus of to 20 points is awarded if the 21 pieces were placed on the board and the last piece placed is a single square. The player with maximum points wins.</string>
